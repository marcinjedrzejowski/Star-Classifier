# 1. Implement the possibility of zero-mean normalization
# 2. Training with the whole dataset!!! (not only 0.02%) --> choose models base on this result
# 3. Hyperparameter Plots (copying manually acc and std dev :) )
# 4. Use SMOTE algorithm instead of undersampling?
# 5. Sum up all libraries used in first cell?
# 6. Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation for unbalanced data
# 7. Maybe some plots for final models
# 8. Copy-pasting the functions I used from my utils into the other utils
